Originally written as support code for the blog post named [Android Databinding: Goodbye Presenter, Hello Viewmodel!](http://tech.vg.no/2015/07/17/android-databinding-goodbye-presenter-hello-viewmodel/).

See tags [mvp](https://github.com/Nilzor/mvp-to-mvvm-transition/tree/mvp) and [mvvm](https://github.com/Nilzor/mvp-to-mvvm-transition/tree/mvvm) referred to by that post.

Later expanded upon to include a more complete Databinding example with full two-way databinding of EditText-fields at the 
[two-way-implicit](https://github.com/Nilzor/mvp-to-mvvm-transition/tree/two-way-implicit) tag,
or manual read-back if you prefer that by the [two-way-explicit](https://github.com/Nilzor/mvp-to-mvvm-transition/tree/two-way-explicit) tag.
